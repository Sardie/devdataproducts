This projects visualize the data from the `San Francisco Crime Classification` competition on Kaggle:
https://www.kaggle.com/c/sf-crime

On the left side, you can see the UI panel. You can filter by all variables that you see there.

Last option is "Color by:", it will split the viewed data by that variable and will display
each level with distinct color. If there are more than 8 levels to show, it will show only top7 levels
and it will merge other levels to "Other" level.

In the centre you can see a map with the crimes colored by the variable you selected. Only subset
with max 1000 crimes is showed.

At the bottom you can see time series data. Per each week you can see the number of crimes that satisfies
the filter criteria.
